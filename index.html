    <h2> Languages | Frameworks | Libraries</h2>
    <h2>Javascript | jQuery | Bootstrap | Node.js | React | HTML | CSS </h2>
        <p>
            My skillset currently involves front-end development using the standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript. However I am also capable in back-end JavaScript with Node.js to 
            create RESTFUL back-ends (“API’s”). I have done web development work in the past as well that involved
             uses of frameworks(“bootstrap”) for interactivity, responsiveness, and speed to make sure to get worked done in the most efficient time frame possible.

    <h2>Work I've Done</h2>
        <p>
           I was 22 in Philladelphia and was working a part time job while learning to code. At this time I had a good idea of Html and Css and was trying to get a grips of the backend.
           There was a nice Blonde lady I ended up helping out at check out and she asked me a few questions about myself and conversation moved towards me talking about API's. She was 
           insistant I go back to school for computer science, but my goal was to prove I could be a top engineer without a degree but I still apreciated her advice. It was at this time 
           that I would run into my current mentor Brian who happened to be a facebook Engineer listening in on the conversation when he introduced himself. Brian then gave me the opportunity
           to go to the Facebook office in NY anytime I wanted. Happy to say I took this offer to heart. Though currently I don't see Brian as often as I would like with his crazy travel schedule
           going to that office was like stepping into my future home. It's like when you know you can achieve something but don't really have an idea of what it looks like and then you 
           magically do.

    <h2> And Why I Feel I'm a Great Canidate </h2>
        <p>
            I know that programming is not easy, however being self-taught has never stopped me from believeing in my skillset and what I bring to the table, I know that which ever group of amazing 
            people I work with, I'll make the best of it and continue to learn and grow as an engineer, and hopefully make an impact on the lives we touch with our products.
            There are definitely times when learning that I could spend hours and sometimes days on a bug that I run into from time to time, but I know it doesn't pay
            off until one day it does. Programming to me is like the ultimate battle of wits, time, and patience with yourself. Whether it's libarary's frameworks, or a new language
            it's all the same. Coding is all the same. It's what you put in, not what you get out. You never know where that first line of code could take you. So my words of motivation to
            you and everyone who comes to my site is one thing. Keep...drinking coffee. Oh yeah and code code code!
