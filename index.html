    <h2> Why I Love Coding</h2>
        <p>
           When I decided to become an software engineer it was because I wasn't truly sure what I had a passion for. Though when I think about it 
           I grew up around technology growing up, I loved messing with
           computers. I enjoyed helping family memebers with problems that seamed mundane to my 13 year old self. I never really fit well in school, everyone had their group of friends.
           but when I looked around I didnt have the "niche" of friends everyone seams to have. The "jocks", the "goth's", the "nerds", the "the theater kids". When I had looked around
           I realized that I had a nack for one, becoming friends with anyone and everyone, and two, was very creative and was not afraid to go out there and step out my comfort zone.
           Because when I was a kid I never had a comfort zone. I beleieve this is why I became an Engineer. I was always curious and always wanted more than a small town that I knew 
           was only a small chapter in the bigger scheme of things. I took risk's people wouldn't. Things that would seam scarry to one, brought life, and was exciting to me. When I decided to become
           an software engineer it was because it meant I could create and be as curious as I could be with out boundaries or limittations. But what no one told me as the 22 year old me
           was how hard it would be to "become" a software engineer.

    <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
        <p>
           I was 22 in Philladelphia and was working a part time job while learning to code. At this time I had a good idea of Html and Css and was trying to get a grips of the backend.
           There was a nice Blonde lady I ended up helping out at check out and she asked me a few questions about myself and conversation moved towards me talking about API's. She was 
           insistant I go back to school for computer science, but my goal was to prove I could be a top engineer without a degree but I still apreciated her advice. It was at this time 
           that I would run into my current mentor Brian who happened to be a facebook Engineer listening in on the conversation when he introduced himself. Brian then gave me the opportunity
           to go to the Facebook office in NY anytime I wanted. Happy to say I took this offer to heart. Though currently I don't see Brian as often as I would like with his crazy travel schedule
           going to that office was like stepping into my future home. It's like when you know you can achieve something but don't really have an idea of what it looks like and then you 
           magically do.

    <h2>Go Far Instead of Trying To Go Quick </h2>
        <p>
            There are definitely times when learning that I could spend hours and sometimes days on a bug that I run into time to time when working, but I know it doesn't pay
            off until one day it does. Programming to me is like the ultimate battle of wits, time, and patience with yourself. Whether it's libarary's frameworks, or a new language
            it's all the same. Coding is all the same. It's what you put in, not what you get out. You never know where that first line of code could take you. So my words of motivation to
            you and everyone who comes to my site is one thing. Keep...drinking coffee. Oh yeah and code code code!
